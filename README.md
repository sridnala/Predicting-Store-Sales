# Predicting-Store-Sales

Sales are the lifeblood of a business. Sales forecasting is a 
crucial part of the financial planning of a business. Sales 
forecasting helps retailers decide how many styles of a 
product to stock.

The overall effect of accurate sales forecasting is a business that runs more efficiently, saving money on excess inventory, increasing profit and 
serving its customers better

Machine learning techniques allow predicting the amount of 
products/services to be purchased during a defined future period.

As part of this project we will be performing following activities to build a sales forcasting model.

* Data Collection.
* Exploratory Data analysis.
* Identifying the Critical Features.
* Model Deployment
* Evaluate Model.
